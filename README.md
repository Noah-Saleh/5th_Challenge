# 5th_Challenge - A Finanical Planner  

## Summary of Purpose  

This is not a program. 
This is just a financial analysis of a client for emergiences and for retirement.

### Part 1: A Financial Planner for Emergencies  
I visualized the current savings of a client. Then I determined if they had enough reserves for an emergency fund.

### Part 2: A Financial Planner for Retirement  
I forecasted the performance of one retirement portfolio for 30 years and another portfolio for 10 years. To do this, I made Alpaca API calls to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
